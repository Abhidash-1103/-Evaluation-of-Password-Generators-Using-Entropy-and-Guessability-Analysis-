# -Evaluation-of-Password-Generators-Using-Entropy-and-Guessability-Analysis-

This project evaluates the strength of passwords generated by different password generators. While password managers reduce user cognitive burden, their password generation modules may still produce weak or guessable passwords. Using three generators — PasswordWolf, RoboForm, and a custom Python-based generator — we produced >10,000 samples for each parameter set (lengths: 8, 12, 20; character classes: letters, letters+digits, letters+symbols, all). We analyzed entropy, character class coverage, and guessability (via Dropbox’s zxcvbn). Results show that password length and character diversity are stronger predictors of security than the choice of generator.
